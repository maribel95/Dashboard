The practice consists of creating a data panel (Data Dashboard). This panel
You would grab the data from a database of your choice in PhPMyAdmin, Xampp. It is an example of
a distributed web application that has a front-end and a back-end.

The development of the practice had used:

- [X] Bootstrap: to configure the front-end.
- [X] JavaScript and JQuery: to be able to modify the contents of the DOM of the web page.
- [X] You can use Ajax from JQuery to extract data from the Apache server files (Xampp) and modify the contents of the DOM of the website based on what was received.
- [X] HighCharts and HighMaps: to make visualizations on the dashboard.
- [X] Xampp, php: for the web server.

## Minimum requirements:

The top of the board has a bar
navigation that contains a link with a navbar-brand class for the dashboard title and an href attribute equal to "#", a link to the UIB website and another link to the data source.
Minimum three visualizations with Highcharts and/or highmaps.

## Main files

In this folder you can find the following files:

1. Folder for our own CSS that we have developed simply to give a style to the panel cover letters.
2. JS folder where we store the self-developed script and a jquery file for the ajax part.
3. PHP folder that contains the .php file that you have not allowed us to connect to the MySql database and perform the relevant queries.

We also find several files:

1. Index.html file, where we have structured the page format.
2. We have exported the database, called adiiu_data.sql, in case the teachers decide to import directly.
3. README.md file where we clarify any possible doubts that may exist about the project.
4. 5-10 minute explanatory video of how the practice works.
## Details

This practice has been carried out on MAC using MAMP instead of XAMPP, so some parameters of the connection to the database could vary.
In particular, the "password" parameter could cause problems.
In MAMP: password = "root"
In XAMPP: password = ""
